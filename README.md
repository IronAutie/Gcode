python gcode.py [ <command> ... <command> ] < -standard input- > -standard output-

commands:
      FX  : flip sign of X coordinates
      FY  : flip sign of Y coordinates
      FXY : flip sign of both X and Y coordinates
      FZ  : flip sign of Z coordinates
      MX  : mirror horizontal in place
      MY  : mirror vertical in place
      MXY : mirror vertical and horizontal in place
      MZ  : mirror depth in place
      Z   : insert z movements where needed to protect cutter
      RX  : rx,
      RY  : ry,
      RXY : rxy,
      RZ  : rz
      <floating point number> : set depth of z movements (default -0.01)

example

python gcode.py -0.1 Z < heart.txt > result.txt
      will insert z movements at - and + 0.1 as needed to plunge cutter or protect cutter
      (reverse the sign if plunge is in opposite direction!)

python gcode.py MXY < result.txt > resultmxy.txt
      will mirror image across x and y axes but keep image in the first quadrant

python gcode.py FXY < result.txt > resultfxy.txt
      will flip image to fourth quadrant
